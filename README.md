# Tracker.NewFS

## What

A fork of the BeOS [OpenTracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenTracker)
called NewFS, back from around 2003.

This software is obsolete now, kept only for historical purposes.

## Who

I'm Attila Lendvai, the original author of the NewFS fork.

## Why

I'm trying to gather the sources of this project that I've lost long
ago in a hard drive crash. This is the last piece of code that I wrote
in C++, and where I "misused" C++ it in interesting ways after having
learned a good deal about metaprogramming in Lisp-like languages.

If you know about any other versions, or you have the sources of the
ThreadMagic library, then please contact me on
[GitHub](https://github.com/attila-lendvai/Tracker.NewFS/), or drop me
a mail at attila@lendvai.name!

Note that I may force-push this repo as needed to build up the
version history.

## Where

The home of this source archival project is on
[GitHub](https://github.com/attila-lendvai/Tracker.NewFS/), but if you
are looking for more info about the NewFS project itself, then you
should head over to [mlotz.ch/newfs/](https://mlotz.ch/newfs/).
