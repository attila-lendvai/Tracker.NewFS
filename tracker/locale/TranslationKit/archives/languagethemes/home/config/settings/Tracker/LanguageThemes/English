* Comments can be made freely, but shouldn't contain double quotes except if you escape them (\").
* They should also, for clarity, be marked as comment. With /* */ for example.
* As a special item, B_UTF8_ELLIPSIS (...) may be placed directly after closing double quotes to indicate
* the item triggers a menu. They will be preprocessed and replaced by their UTF8 representation.
